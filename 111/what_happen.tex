Now, let's take a look at the Euler equation:\\

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        U(C_{t})&=\beta\times U(C_{t+1})\times[1+f(k_{t})-\delta]\\
        K_{t+1}&=(1-\delta)K_{t} + I_{t}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

 $U(C_{t})=\beta\times U(C_{t+1})\times[1+f(k_{t})-\delta]\\$
 $K_{t+1}=(1-\delta)K_{t} + I_{t}\\$


For here, we are going to set up a brand-new method to evaluate utiltity:

this is not what we want.
we need to figure out what is the best solution for both consumer and firms.
